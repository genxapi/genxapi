Absolutely, let’s bundle all that tooling context up into a nice coherent summary for the AI.

### 🛠️ Tooling Context for the AI

To give the AI a clear understanding of the tooling setup, here’s the full picture:

1. **Strict-CLI (by Bloomberg)**: We’re using `strict-cli` because it’s a lightweight tool with no third-party dependencies. This makes it easy to maintain and perfect for creating consistent, reproducible project setups. It ensures that every project starts with the same solid foundation.

2. **TypeScript**: The template is fully configured to use TypeScript. This takes advantage of Orval’s ability to generate TypeScript types, so consumers get a type-safe, out-of-the-box experience with minimal setup.

3. **ESLint**: We’ve included ESLint with the latest standards to ensure code quality and maintainability. This means the generated projects will follow best practices and be easy to refactor.

Together, these tools create a seamless workflow for generating, maintaining, and delivering high-quality, type-safe API client projects.

And there we have it! That should give the AI a solid understanding of how to use all the tooling. Let me know if you need anything else!
